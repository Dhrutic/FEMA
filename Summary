Scope: Predict the loss ratio (Claims/ Total Insured Value) for flood events induced by Hurricane

Summary
The dataset is derived from the system of national insurance flood act. The data sets consist historical data of 42 attributes and 
2.5 millions of records. The attributes include information of Policy, Coverage values, Claim Values, location info,
building features, elevation, Flood Vulnerability and miscellaneous details.

To identify claim records for flood event induced by Hurricane, a historical data set of hurricane events for 50 years was used. 
This allowed the data to segregate into two categories
1. Hurricane induced flood 
2. Actual flood

After extracting records reported for flood claims induced by Hurricane, the No of records remaining for further analysis was 844k. 
A Hurricane can event may cause flood after few days from the beginning of the event. We assumed that the duration could range from 
5 to 7 days. Based on the no of days and the affected states, records with flood claims were extracted.
